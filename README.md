# Connectastic iOS

* Written using [XCode 6.1](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/).  Could use [Jetbrains AppCode](https://www.jetbrains.com/objc/) instead.
* Using [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) to manage dependencies.  See `Podfile` in this directory.
* See [The CocoaPod Guide](http://guides.cocoapods.org/) to learn how to use Cocoapods.
* Learning Swift and iOS development using [this tutorial](https://www.bloc.io/tutorials/swiftris-build-your-first-ios-game-with-swift#!/chapters/675).  The [Swift Language Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/TheBasics.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH5-XID_467) is helpful too.
* Skeleton of Connectastic iOS generated using the XCode's Page Based Application Template.
* Facebook interaction by using the Facebook iOS SDK (Objective C) via CocoaPods, and imported into Swift using a [bridging header](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/swift/conceptual/BuildingCocoaApps/MixandMatch.html).  See `BridgingHeader.h` for implementation.  Swift code doesn't need to import anything with this header in place.
